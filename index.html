        <h1>Game Programming Mini Contest Site</h1>
        <h3>Basic Idea</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>GAE, so sign in with your google account</li>
            <li>You can create challenges, which correspond to contest themes.
           Challenges require moderator approval before they are made visible to the
           public.</li>
           <li>You can "accept" challenges for a given time-frame.  You must specify
           a github repository, and a start time.</li>
           <li>When your time on a challenge is up, the site automatically forks your
           github repository for posterity, and checks the presence of a LICENSE file
           and that it's the MIT license.</li>
           <li>Your binary and repository URL are presented to the community for voting.
           The community can vote a) that you're within the spirit of the challenge
           and give you a score out of ten, or b) that you're not within the spirit
           of the challenge.</li>
           <li>When voting is up, you get as many points as were voted, unless sufficient
           people voted you outside the spirit.</li>
           <li>You can cash in your points for rewards, such as software licenses donated
           by sponsors.  We'll suggest a value of points to the sponsors, eg. 
           one point = $2USD (or perhaps one point = $1USD and increase the points
           for challenge).</li>
           <li>I think restricting how many times you can vote without participating in
           challenges is probably the best way to reduce spam votes.  Perhaps make it
           so you automatically get 5 votes for contributing an approved challenge
           idea and 10 votes for contributing a within-the-spirit contest entry?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I'd like to allow google code hosting as well as github, or even instead,
        but I think it requires moderator approval for projects and not sure it makes
        it easy for us to fork repositories for posterity.</li>
            <li>Each entry would be presented for eternity on the page of the challenge it
        fulfills.</li>
            <li>Challenges and entries would be taggable and searchable.</li>
            <li>There's a problem of how to host binaries.</li>
            <li>Need an interface for sponsors to put up prizes, allow participants to claim
        said prizes, deduct points when the sponsor claims to have shipped the
        prizes, allow users to complain about negligent sponsors, etc.</li>
            <li>Allow mac, linux, iphone entries? or?</li>
            <li>Front page would be a description of the site with ways to get to the various
        sections, and a real-time-updating timeline of what's happening on the site
        (new challenges, entries, etc.)</li>
            <li>I'd like to put in the concept of a "rush" or something, where multiple
        participants agree to attempt the same challenge on the same timeframe, and
        to encourage participation in such.  Perhaps more points on reward.</li>
        </ul>
